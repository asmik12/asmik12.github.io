I want to harness the power of Machine Learning and AI-powered tools to make quality education accessible, to derive actionable insights from climate data, to analyze and mitigate emerging cyber risk, and ultimately drive positive change.

Current research interests: Machine Learning/AI/Deep Learning, Watermarking for AI Generated Content, Large Language Models, Attentive Mechanisms, Climate Modelling

Professional interests: AI for EdTech (to make education more accessible, equitable and personalized for learners of all levels), AI for FinTech (using ML models to understand financial risk and model futures), Cybersecurity in AI (Developing defenses against adversarial attacks, Watermarking for AI generated media)

Stuff I love to do: LEGO, cubing (2x2x2 or Pyraminx, not a fan of 3x3x3!), photography, reading fiction, writing, bullet journalling
