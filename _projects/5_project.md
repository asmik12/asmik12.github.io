The concept of this club stemmed from a desire to be different, to provide a space for others like us who loved learning. Conceived, proposed, developed and conducted virtually during the pandemic, this project united a group of upperclassmen who brought their passion for problem solving to inspire groups of 7th, 8th and 9th graders.

The report below chronicles our journey from never having taught/tutored before to developing our own curriculum and delivering it to a group of learners over a period of just 4 months. It is quite amazing to reflect on the immense personal and professional growth we went through together as a team of 10, despite being so disconnected due to the pandemic.
