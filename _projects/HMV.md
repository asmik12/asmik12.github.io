First ever edition of the A Level Student Anthology, developed and published during the pandemic, is a compilation of writings on topics of social significance ranging from Climate Change to Social Issues & Current Affairs. My goal in proposing this project was to create a space for other young people like myself to express their views on issues they felt genuinely passionate about.

This Human Rights Day, we are exercising our Freedom of Thought and Freedom of Expression to make our voices heard on real issues that we hold dear. Even the pandemic couldn't hold us back!
